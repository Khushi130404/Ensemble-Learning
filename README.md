# Ensemble_Learning

This project demonstrates various ensemble learning techniques using Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to explore how ensemble methods can improve the performance of machine learning models for both regression and classification tasks.

## Techniques Covered

The following ensemble methods have been implemented and evaluated in this project:
- Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting)
- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest
- Stacking Ensemble
- Voting Ensemble
